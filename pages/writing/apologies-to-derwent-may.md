## apologies to derwent may*

**Sunday 21 April 2019**

we are hogweed  
six feet tall

being gathered  
to feed pigs 

we are yellow  
archangels in  
shady woods  

we do not sting.

**Monday 1 April 2019**

we are hobbies  
nesting in old crows' nests  
in quiet woods or small copses   
in the middle of ploughed fields.

**Wednesday 20 March 2019**

<small>for fieke

we are wind flowers  
hanging lightly  
on our stems.

we spread across the floor  
of dead leaves  
in woods and copses. 

and we turn our backs  
when the march winds blow.

i am a coltsfoot  
on a bare riverbank

i am a persian speedwell  
on the muddy edge of a cornfield

i am a dandelion with teeth  
like a lion lurking somewhere  
waiting for clocks.

i am a lesser celandine  
and you are a primrose  
and you... you can be a bluebell  
but look out! here comes  
the fucking winter heliotrope.

**Thursday, 21 February 2019**

let's be pairs of goldcrests  
and build mossy nests  
filled with feathers  
suspended  
under fir or cypress boughs.

**Thursday, 31 January 2019**

we are nuthatches looking   
into large holes in trees.

we are long-tailed tits  
leaving the tit flocks.

we are ravens working on  
our nests on cliff ledges.

**Thursday, 17 January 2019**

i am one of the few  
	of the millions  
of commercially reared  
	pheasants let loose  
in english woods last autumn  
	who didn't get shot,  
yet — and when i say 'kork,   
kork' what i mean is : 'i'm   
	looking forward, very much,  
to the end of the month.'

**Saturday, 12 January 2019**

i am a loon on a lake  
wailing uncannily in a sinister  
foggy movie scene.

**Wednesday, 9 January 2019**

we are waxwings wandering  
into supermarket carparks  
looking for cotoneasters.

**Wednesday, 19 December 2018**

i am a feral snow goose  
flying freely with my flock  
about the inner hebrides

------

**Monday, 10 December 2018**

i am a black-tailed godwit  
feeding in deep water   
mostly out of sight   
below the surface.  

------

**Monday, 24 September 2018**

i am a silvery grey greenshank  
walking gracefully on long green legs

knowing where an elm hedge is,  
can lead you to a white letter  
hairstreak butterfly — and/or if you see

a white letter hairstreak butterfly,  
you may find a nearby elm hedge  
that you didn’t know about.

(there are lots of elm hedges, i am sure,  
that i don’t know about — and even more  
white letter hairstreak butterflies.)

7:23 AM :  
and now, in between bursts  
of song, chiffchaffs  
(or zilpzalps, as the germans, who have  
a different word for everything!  
say) are making soft   
hiccuping sounds and   
no one knows why.

great hairy willowherb! you are  
not the first to make an  
appearance in damp ditches —  
that would be your sister  
who grows at the feet of walls.

**no date**

like small birds  
on icy mornings  
trying to live.

*<small> my obsession with derwent may's daily nature notes in the u.k. times (hidden so deep inside the 'comments' page that you can't even link to it) began when i still lived in australia and i was fascinated by the things that animals and plants were doing at that moment in the northern hemisphere (which, now that i've been living here again for a few years, i realise is actually a different planet). each weekday derwent may writes a little piece about what is happening. i love the names of the animals and the plants and the little details, and sometimes i am compelled to pull something out and/or i imagine myself being one or more of the animals or plants and/or i address them, mostly by appropriating derwent may's words, perhaps rearranging them slightly and/or putting each detail on a line by itself. i don't call them poems because i am not a poet (although i did send some to plumwood journal once but they didn't like them) but i don't know what they are. texts? tweets? ideally they'd be tweetable, not that i often do. i often forget that i can tweet!

<small>i am not a poet,  but perhaps i'm a [writer](writing) — in any case i've been a collagist for almost as long as i've been writing. and i've been writing since before most of you fuckers were even BORN. that's such an old man thing to say but i guess i am as good (or as bad) as an old man now so maybe that's ok? or maybe its not. usually i check myself if i'm tempted to say an old man thing. so cutting up texts is something that i do. but i am old school : i almost always acknowledge the source and/or offer my apologies to the writer.

<small>so. apologies to derwent may. i imagine him an old man in a little cottage in the english country side somewhere who wears a bow tie and goes on long walks each day to gather material for his columns which he composes on a [powerbook 100](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook/specs/mac_powerbook100.html) after dinner but i might be wrong about that. maybe he's not well, it often seems to be his off-sider who writes the column these days. 

<small>when i get around to it i will collect all the nature notes ~~poems~~ texts here. the dates usually correspond to the dates on which the column was published but not always.
