## wtf? dharma!?

if you'll allow me just for a moment to appropriate a word/idea from buddhism/hinduism …

 *— but wait. you say, if we are going to excoriate the word/idea '[god](../god)' from our [conversations about what matters](http://johannesk.blot.im/conversations) surely we ought equally to avoid word/ideas from other religious traditions?* 

{>|} <small>i also still find invoking the word/idea god useful in exclamations and exhortations, as in *oh my fucking god* and *please help me lord* and the like.</small>

well yes and no, perhaps not necessarily every word/idea all the time. take for example the word/idea ['sacred'](http://www.johannesk.com/2018-december#crisis), if we are clear that in a post-theist posthumanist [post-love](post-love) context *any thing* (or idea) can be sacred, if it is experienced as such by someone (… latterly i've been thinking that perhaps it needs at least two humans for whom something is sacred for it to reach its fullest possible meaning) it can be useful. 

buddhism/zen/taoism is peripheral to what i think/feel/believe now but sometimes someone comes up to me after i've given a talk and says : isn't this just buddhism? or zen? (i want to make a special dunce hat to give to them, or perhaps a more discreet, and rather stylish dunce hat badge that they can wear with pride because to ask a stupid question is better than not asking a question at all unless you're trying to be a smart arse in which case : no dunce hat for you! but i might say, do you smoke? and if they say yes, i will propose going outside for a smoke.)

my connection with buddhism/zen/taoism dates from the seventies when i was reading allan watts and the beats and krishnamurti and studying chinese medicine — sparked by *zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance* — and trying to get a handle on 'the problem'. i realised that those old schmoopers were really onto something with the idea that it is the self, the ego, that is the problem. bingo! but then they came up with all this other bullshit omg and over thousands of years they became completely embroiled in a vast amount of complete bullshit and bureaucracy and power structures and corruption and money that it became even more ridiculous than christianity for fuck sake. it is just less obvious from where we are because it is from over there and seems exotic.

shame, shame! [^1] 

but 'dharma' is a word/idea which still has a an engaging mysterious ring to it doesn't it and all those people with the fucking buddha statues in their windowsills and in their gardens as a water feature wouldn't have a clue what you're on about if you asked them for their views on dharma.

i like its connection with the beats who discovered buddhism in the 1950s and appropriated it and made the word/idea do the work that it was necessary for them to do for a time — jack kerouac was writing the infamous 'dharma bums' at the same time as the foetus that ultimately became the collection of atoms that i am now was forming in the uterus of my mother, in [this house in florida](http://johannesk.com.s3.amazonaws.com/1__%23$!@%25!%23__Pasted%20Graphic.tiff) — (dharma bums that is, not my mother's uterus) so in a way i was formed at the same time as an influential contemporary idea of what dharma could be was being formed. 

*yeah but why should i care about that, you old bore?*  
not saying you should, jim, not saying you should — but for a moment, just for a moment, just for the time it takes to read this page and then i'll never mention it again, let the word/idea dharma stand for the ultimate nature or reality, for what-is, for the world and everything in it and of it, everything that ever was and that is now and that ever will be, and the universe and the ten to the power of five hundred universes and the eleven dimensions, as seen from a perspective outside of human consciousness, where time, the self and the human have been completely decentered or as much as is possible in the context of being human.

can we each discover what dharma is for ourselves or do we have to read ancient texts or be seduced by and submit to a master who can tell us? can we learn something from what those people who've been thinking about dharma for thousands of years thought and wrote about it, or do we have to more or less directly apprehend it, each of us, for ourselves?

given the limitations of language which is a tool primarily evolved as a result of the need to name things and to transmit knowledge about things that matter to (some) humans, useful for agriculture, and getting things done but completely corrupted and useless for thinking about what is real and for describing or thinking about what can happen when the boundaries that it necessarily creates begin to dissolve clearly dharma could not be described in words. it is apopathetic. you can read all the books in the world and listen to the words of humans and talk until you're blue in the face (and i am not saying that therefore there is no point in reading and writing and talking and listening) you are not going to get any closer to knowing what dharma is, to experience it — which is not saying you won't learn anything useful by looking for and finding what [karl jaspers](phd/thinkers#jaspers) calls *chiffren* or traces, but there is danger : one can easily become charmed by or drunk on the energy emitted by an other — yes i'm talking about you bhaghwan shree rashneesh and all those other schmoopers — and spend the rest of one's life in adoration and worship — and you will pay $5,000 so you can own one of his old robes and some would have us believe that that is a religious life that this is what spirituality it but this is not punk theology. it is not posthumanism. it is not postspiritual.

ok you can forget about dharma now.  
as you were.  
carry on!
