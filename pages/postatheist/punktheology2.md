# punk theology (ii)

#### about theology

my hypothesis is that the discipline or field of theology occupies a unique position in the academy.

> theology is not religious studies, or philosophy, or anthropology, or critical theory, or literature studies — nor is it, clearly, psychology. but it is at least partly, about the practice of everyday life as a human being, the thoughts and feelings and actions of human beings - especially in response to the unknown, the unknowable and what i propose to call, the unbeknownst.

#### the unbeknownst

Used by Dickens and E.B. White amongst others, the word **unbeknownst** has been referred to as "obsolete" and "vulgar" which makes it useful in the context of what i want to call punk theology.

what would be the difference between something that is known and something what is *beknown*? for it contains the idea of something which is known *by* a being, and it is actively *being* known, if that is not too obscure. 

i am not so interested in the kind of knowledge production being practiced in the academy or for that matter the artworld.

i am interested in a discipline which investigates experiences and interprations of experiences. 
theology produces both theorists and practitioners … of what? 

for example : in which discipline within the academy can i say "everything is possible" — in art you could (and i did) but art is really at the dodgy end of the academy where many would be academics hide ha ha... where else, in a music academy someone might say it, in achitecture … maybe once upon a time. 

in quantum physics … but i cannot speak about that since my knowledge and understanding of quantum physics would fit inside a subatomic particle.

how do i explain my position regarding that statement? it is not an attempt at a rational or logical statement, an assertion, the truth of which can be argued. such a statement cannot be proved nor can it can be defended by citing or providing evidence. 

and if i say *everything has to be possible* — it is, in effect, a religious statement, a statement of faith.

#### why punk?

because punk is anti-establishment — because there is swearing, irreverence, provocation and the insistence on absolute freedom 

punk is irreverent

punk is : i only know three chords — but i want to sing, write songs, make music.

i did punk as a 19 year old and as a 28 year old (in art) and as a forty something in the academy, albeit at the dodgy end of it, and in an obscure regional australian university.

i did it as a non-religious pastoral carer and a writer in my fifties and now aged 60, i am a teenage theologist who doesn't believe that it is about whether you believe in god. it is about whether you believe in anything at all.

i used to believe in politics
i used to believe in art 
i used to believe in music 
i think i still believe in writing, 
the practice of it, and reading — 
but i am full of doubt,  oh lord. 

i believe there is [a spiritual crisis](http://www.johannesk.com/2018-december#crisis).

so what are the three chords you know?

#### (i) E : the problem

> you are afraid and you are sad and you are angry — or perhaps your feel your life is meaningless  — and the world is a shambles.

we may well speak in terms of a [spiritual crisis](http://www.johannesk.com/2018-december#crisis).

#### (ii) A : the conversation

> so let's talk about it. you can talk and i can listen — or i can say something, or ask you a question.

#### (iii) B : love

B is the hardest of the three chords to play, and it serves a special function because most songs go something like E-A-E-A-E-A and then B
