# random notes and questions 

## towards a phd proposal

1. Perhaps my PhD thesis could take the form of <strike>a prosimetrum (a prose work with verse interludes)</strike> like *The Consolation of Philosophy* (the title of which was hijacked by the odious Alain de Botton) by Boethius who may or may not have been a Christian (probably not) written in prison before he was executed in 524AD.
2. Why do a PhD? Don't you already have one?  
     — Yes but…
3. Why Theology?   
     Because there is a spiritual crisis.   
     And we need to have a conversation about what is sacred.   
     In a Theology context if you say you want to talk about what is sacred no one bats an eye lid. The flip side of that is : a lot of people in theology have significant investments in what they believe to be sacred and if you say you're a punk theologist and you insist that we don't talk about god you're likely to upset and/or irritate some people. But so be it.
