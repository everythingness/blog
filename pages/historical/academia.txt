It's hard to say exactly when I gave up on academia. I'd become seriously [unwell](well) in December 2005. I gave up first [alcohol](alcohol) and then [art](art) and since art was what I taught, and alcohol was how I coped with work, that was a problem. 

It never occurred to me to do something else but working at the university gradually became more and more unpalatable. When I first began teaching it seemed to be a good way to combine working for money and art making. The hours were flexible. There was some seriously good equipment. Some of the students were talented (or crazy in an interesting way) and the people I worked with were nice. 

But then the bean counters began to make their influence felt. They closed the art school and turned it into a school of creative industries. They canned the undergraduate visual arts programme and then the writing was on the wall. And then other things happened, like we were required to reverse engineer research questions for art works we had made years ago. 

I gave an interview in 2005 for an [article in realtime](http://www.realtimearts.net/article/issue74/8168) in Australia, just as the rot was setting in. [Here is the full text](http://johannesk.com.s3.amazonaws.com/interview%20from%202005.pdf)....
