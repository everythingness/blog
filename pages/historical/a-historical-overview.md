## A Historical Overview of my Art Practice and Research 

In my art practice I have traditionally worked under a number of different pseudonyms. I worked under the name Dan Zero from 1991-2005 and as such I have exhibited widely both internationally and nationally during that time, including curated group exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, Australian Perspecta in Sydney, and at the International Symposium on Electronic Art exhibition in Montreal. Dan Zero was one of the Australian interactive multimedia artists included on the Australian art journal Artlink's 1996 seminal CDROM survey of Australian electronic arts (Sequinz) along luminaries such as Patricia Piccinini, Linda Dement and Robyn Stacey. 

In 1993 I began using the pseudonym i.j.oog for some of my text/art and writing activities. In 2004 one of i.j.oog's short stories was selected for inclusion in Best Australian Stories 2004, edited by Frank Moorhouse and published by Black Inc. During the latter half of 2004 a Writing Up Award from the University allowed me to work on a proposed short story collection inbetween days. I have also made images generated from text fragments of some of my stories which were shown in an exhibition in the School of Visual and Performing Arts H.R.Gallop Gallery in 1997 and 1999. 

In March of 1997 in a special issue on Fictions, the Melbourne art journal Dialogue published an extensive 'round table' discussion on the cultural implications of the new technologies with the writer Ryszard Dabek and Dan Zero, i.j.oog and I.K.Bonset, a pseudonym I hijacked from the Dutch avantgardist Theo van Doesburg who was from my home town of Utrecht. I was also invited to design a website for that issue. I have also created and exhibited analogue artworks as I.K.Bonset and sudrar eg, and I have performed and recorded experimental sound works as The Alpha Jerks and minus eleven error. 

In 1997 ZeroMan, a CDROM collaboration with SVPA lecturer in Photography Raimond de Weerdt, was shortlisted for the prestigious Zentrum fur Kunst und Medien International Video Art Prize, and selected for exhibition at the Staatliche Kunnsthalle in Baden Baden Germany, as well as being broadcast on television in a number of European countries. Zeroman was also exhibited internationally in 1998 in Utrecht, The Netherlands at the Impakt Festival and in Sheffield, UK at the Love Bytes Festival. 

In the same year I presented a paper A LoRes Sublime and exhibited interactive digital work at Decode the first digital art conference to be held in Wagga Wagga. I also returned to Newcastle for the Electrofringe Festival where I was one of the speakers in the "Exploring the potential of New Media for artists" seminar. 

As minus eleven error I have performed at numerous venues in Sydney, Melbourne and Wagga Wagga, including the Wagga Wagga Voices Festival. My works have been included on a number of compilation CDs. In 2002 minus eleven error was commissioned to create a soundwork for The Listening Room by the ABC. This work entitled Returning has been broadcast extensively in Australia, and was included on the CD Anthology of Australian Music published by the National Screen and Sound Archive and ANU in 2003. 

In 1999 I was invited to exhibit in the Watt Space Newcastle Watt Decade Exhibition and the exhibition I had curated in the School of Visual and Performing Arts HR Gallop Gallery in 1996 (then called zero k used) was shown at Watt Space as The Doors Show, Newcastle in 2000. Zero, oog, and minus eleven error participated in Transference the SVPA Staff Show at the Wagga Wagga Regional Gallery in 2000 and in the same year I was invited to collaborate with the Dutch artist Yvonne van der Velden on a work for Harmonia at West Space and the accompanying audio CD as part of the Next Wave Festival Melbourne. 

In December 2002 I was invited to mount a solo exhibition at the Wagga Wagga Regional Art Gallery entitled a limited catalogue of endless things as part of my work towards a Doctor of Philosophy in Fine Art which was awarded in 2003. The Gallery published an exhibition catalogue with critical essays by Neill Overton and Ryszard Dabek and an audio CD minus eleven error 97-02 to accompany the exhibition. 

I am a founding member of the Wagga Space Program, a collective of experimental sound and visual artists based in Wagga Wagga which organizes the bi-annual unsound festival. In 2004 I collaborated on a site specific installation with renowned experimental sound artist Oren Ambarchi the result of which, a screwdriver#2 was exhibited as part of the Mutable Landscapes festival in the Junee Roundhouse Museum to critical acclaim. 

I have published and presented a number of papers about my work and issues in new media and digital arts at conferences (including ISEA 2000 in Paris), and reviews of exhibitions and CDROMs in journals such as Metro and Australian Screen Education. 

In 2006 I was invited to be artist in residence and visiting lecturer at the Department of Architecture and Art History Virginia Polytechnic and Technical University in the USA, and to exhibit my digital video work La Favorite in the Armory Gallery in Blacksburg VA. 

I present a contemporary alternative, independent and experimental music programme saftmasheen on the Wagga Wagga community radio station FM107.1 Thursdays from 8- 10pm.
