## your love is killing me

jeezus, this song by sharon van etten is a fucking tour de force, an anthem for all those who had to stop loving someone because it was too painful. 

i am now fully post-love but only since the sad, bad summer of 2018, so it's still very fresh in the old 'moi profundo' but yeah.

put your headphones on, play LOUD â€” and WEEP.
