As This Is Us returns to our screens, Dolly Alderton celebrates her favourite genre of TV — box of tissues required

I really hated This Is Us when I first watched it. A saccharine, overblown, American-as-apple-pie series with a timeline that jumps between the story of a couple who meet in the 1970s, their three children growing up in the 1980s, and where they all are in the present day. And yet I found myself watching episode two. Then three. Following this narrative tapestry of children growing up and making mistakes and carving identities and watching how one couple meeting in a bar and falling in love can sprawl outward into the world, like a river spills into an ocean and ... oh dear, I’m tearing up just typing it. That’s the other thing I should probably tell you: from episode two onwards, I have cried, without fail, every single time I have watched This Is Us.

This is therapy TV: intense emotional catharsis via Netflix and Amazon and iPlayer. It gives us permission to be sentimental. Permission to feel. Before I knew it, the episodes weren’t coming fast enough on Channel 4, and I was on a long and winding expedition through various torrent websites manically closing online casino adverts every Wednesday to find the latest episode. Fortunately series two is finally, legally, coming to Channel 4 soon.

How did this happen? My weekly cry at This Is Us became part of a quiet routine for wellbeing, like the bimonthly visit from my cleaner, or my thrice-weekly trip to the gym. Therapy TV is more about how it makes you feel than the specific quality of the content, watching it is like a hoover around your insides, 100 sit-ups for the soul. It’s a corner of culture where you’re allowed just to soften until you’re melted butter.

Daniele Rugo, senior lecturer in film and TV practice at Brunel University, tells me that the human need to connect to these sorts of stories is a need for catharsis without responsibility. “Even though the tools and technology of storytelling have changed, the cathartic mechanism is the same as it was in Greek tragedy,” he says. “The immersion in the spectacle and identification with people on screen provides a release from the tensions we live in our everyday life. The rise of therapy television responds to this same need to experience complicated emotions risk-free, without consequences.”

I find this a very convincing theory, that the rollercoaster of emotions experienced when we watch therapy TV is just that, a rollercoaster, a game. A simulated experience when we can feel and cry, and our hearts can warm and mend and break without any accountability for the events, relationships or characters involved. It’s a safe, fictional place to purge your feelings without having to rationalise, argue, express or explain them to anyone.

The other reason this sort of television is so therapeutic is that the stories told are often so familiar and recognisable. There are the miraculous and monotonous realities of having babies explored in One Born Every Minute or Call the Midwife; the array of human life that passes through the hospital of Grey’s Anatomy. There are the shows about family, such as Amazon’s Transparent, the four-series-strong story of how a 70-year-old’s decision to transition from male to female affects his large, loud, desperately flawed, but somehow entirely lovable, wacky Jewish family in California.

Then there’s the BBC’s Mum, starring Lesley Manville as a 59-year-old recently widowed woman in the suburbs trying to move on with her life in the year after her husband’s death. Every episode is set in her very ordinary home, and characters are as exotic and far-flung as her lifelong friend, her brother, her son and his girlfriend. “Nothing happens and yet everything happens,” a Mum fan tells me, explaining what I think is at the core of all therapy TV: exploring life’s biggest themes through the smallest moments. If the real point of therapy is to understand yourself better, this is the function of these programmes. We watch them not to escape into glamour, high drama, wealth or the exotic; we are searching for ourselves reflected back at us, our family arguments, our birth stories, our grief, our lost and new loves, and our relationships. This is telly that helps us piece together our purpose in life, the mistakes we’ve made, the blessings we’ve enjoyed and what we’ve learnt.

What makes me cry isn’t the big dramatic scenes — in which This Is Us is lacking — it’s the small moments of loyalty and love, intimacy and traditions, exploring memory and childhood and how the most mundane minutes of our past form who we are. On Twitter, viewers gather together and virtually hold hands, typing fragments of thoughts such as “That bit at the lake!!!” and “But she can’t die, we can’t let her die?!!” and posting photographic proof of our tears.

“We look back. We move forward. That’s our collective journey,” tweeted Dan Fogelman, the show’s creator. “Sad? Yes. But when you look through a wide enough lens — it’s also outrageously beautiful.” In other words, therapy TV delivers the bulky fabric of humanity to us in small but perfect patchwork pieces, reminding us of what is really important in life. The viewing experience becomes less about investing in the characters and more about what the characters represent. When we cry at these shows, we are crying for all the things we don’t have time or space or energy to think about while we’re busy trying to be efficient and brilliant and woke and well read and productive and clever and sexy and tough.

We’re crying for our childhoods and the things that we miss and the things we can never change. We’re crying for every funeral we’ve been to, and every one we’ve imagined; every argument in every kitchen; every first kiss we’ve ever had. We’re crying about how long and wide and high and low life can feel, and marvelling with both awe and dread at how we’ll ever get through it in one piece. We’re crying simply because we’re crying — allowing ourselves to absorb how overwhelming being human can feel for just one moment on our sofa when no one is watching.

Permission to be sentimental — turns out we’re all desperate for it.
