{>} <small>you can also make some text or an image appear by itself  </small>![](https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1fybjjioik0j304g04gjr8.jpg)<small>within a column like this.

what really gave me the shits about religion when i was young was not [~~god~~](http://www.johannesk.com/god) or the idea that there were things i couldn't see or feel or understand that were hugely important — that seemed obvious and i wanted to know about those things — it was that the people who claimed to know about those things (and about one Thing in particular) had very definite opinions about what i should do and not do, and their claim that those opinions came *from* that Thing.
