## horror autoxicus

**so like millions of people all over the world (4 million in the UK, 30 million in the US) i have some form of autoimmune disorder.** 

it started, or i became aware of it, more than 12 years ago and they told me : you have lupus, and i was like, oh. what?!! what's that?

what was good about the diagnosis was, i cleaned up my act, stopped drinking alcohol, stopped smoking pot and tobacco, and started walking every morning for an hour. i did feel better. other doctors did more tests and said that maybe i didn't have lupus but that there are certain unexplainable irregularities in my blood and urine.

i was more or less functional for the decade that followed. i was managing the fatigue and headaches and backpain and 'flare ups' â€” i developed things like tinnitus and hyperacusis and frozen shoulders.

over the last 12 months things have taken a turn for the worse and everything came to a head when i embarked on a long journey where everything went wrong. this took a lot out of the body and at a certain point i had to make the decision that i Hwould have to turn back.
