The Sunday Times agony aunt today :

> *Dear Mrs Mills*

> *I’m bored with my husband. After six years of marriage, I feel as if I have finally woken up to just what a dullard he is. We don’t have any children (he’s waiting for us to be “more financially secure”). Is there a proven course of action to enliven dull men or should I give up on him and move on?*

> While it is true that live-wire men can turn into boring old farts, the reverse never happens. Once a bore, always a bore. So you are going to have to go through the dreadful business of disentangling yourself from him.

yep.  
be very afraid.  
one day your beautiful wife will wake up and realise you are a dullard.
