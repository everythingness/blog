> my work is [writing](writing) and talking with and listening to people — people who want to find a different way to be, a different way of being in the world — and in the process, perhaps we can begin to make a different world.  

some of those people are already finding their own way and for them the benefit of the conversations is more affirming : what they need is a conversation with someone who has been thinking along similar lines, perhaps for a bit longer, who might have some additional insights to offer. 

other people i work with are lost, some are broken, others are in despair. a conversation for them can be a consolation — i am a qualified spiritual carer, but independent and non-religious. 

some conversations can be more like therapy. i am a qualified narrative therapist, but i do not apply or enforce any specific rigid method, or wilfully dig through the past. here the work is more like thinking collectively and collaboratively working through the entanglements, and emotions and cognitive turmoil — and envisaging a new way of being and a different world.

i also work with and advise people who want to end their lives.

the [conversations](http://posthumanist.org/conversations) take place in groups, or one to one — or both. 

all conversations are free of dogma, superstition, creed and religion. no one is subjected to anything. everyone retains their autonomy and their agency — and sometimes someone gets something, or loses something.

this is not a 'professional' service, i have no insurance and i do not charge fees. there are no costs to the conversations, unless i incur travel expenses. 

but of course anyone is welcome to [make a donation](http://paypal.me/johannesk) at any time.
