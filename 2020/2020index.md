### about me :

my name is johannes klabbers.  
welcome to my website.

i am a [writer](writing) and a therapist, of sorts, and a spiritual care worker and educator... 

i am a provisional spiritual care training supervisor at the [peter mccallum cancer centre](https://www.petermac.org) in melbourne australia. are you interested in training as a spiritual care worker? click here.

i wrote a book called _i am here_, about which chris kraus said : 

> It’s beautifully written, incredibly moving and lingering … terrible, ordinary, tragic.

i live and work near utrecht in the netherlands and in melbourne, australia — and on the internets. 

in various former lives i was an artist, an academic, and a guitarist in a punk band called the violators, london, 1977.

[now](now) i have conversations with people about being and mattering and what matters — and life and death. i also talk with people who want to die and/or who want to be able to die humanely at a time of their own choosing. 

this is my work but it's not how i 'make a living'. i don't charge fees but i accept [donations](donate) to offset the cost of living. 

are you interested in a having a conversation with me? click here.

i am a would-be posthuman/ist.

<small>other than the above, the intended audience of this website is mainly people that know me and my work (and who get my sense of humour which may well be an acquired taste...) 

is not really addressing people that don't. i would rather speak to people that want to know about me and my work in person. please feel free to get in touch and/or read or listen to me read my book. 

on the other hand if you want to have a look around, feel free. </small>
