"Don’t say *mourning*", Roland Barthes wrote on November 30th, "It’s too psychoanalytic. I’m not mourning. I’m suffering."

## Six Impossible Things

I have a couple of ... um ... issues with this review by Samuel Graydon in The Times Literary Supplement of what looks like a useful little book, *Six Impossible Things* by John Gribbin, but it's a great read and it does a pretty good job in summarising the core problems of the physicalist/realist view of the world, time, space and everything in it and the im/possibilities afforded by quantum theory.

<small>i hacked it a bit — apologies ...</small>

> Depending on how you interpret the results from a litany of physical and mathematical experiments, you are left, basically speaking, with only so many possibilities of how you might understand the world. In Six Impossible Things, John Gribbin chooses six of them and he sees them as solaces, interpretations which offer consolation in the face of the mighty mysteriousness of the ten to the power of five hundred universes and the eleven dimensions.

> One. The world does not exist unless you look at it.

> Two. Particles are pushed around by an invisible wave. But the particles have no influence on the wave.

> Three. Everything that could possibly happen does, in an array of parallel realities.

> Four. Everything that could possibly happen has already happened and we only noticed part of it.

> Five. Everything influences everything else instantly, as if space does not exist.

> Six. The future influences the past.
