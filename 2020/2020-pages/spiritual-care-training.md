# becoming a 'spiritual' carer

the word 'spiritual' is deeply problematic but until we find and agree on a different word (or we could use an ellipsis ...) we will just have to try and overcome speech with speech... [^1]

having experienced first hand the vastly different systems for training and employing 'spiritual carers' in australia (see my book) and the netherlands, i would seriously recommend anyone who is 

if you've read my book (or even if you haven't) and you are interested in training as a spiritual carer, i am a provisional supervisor in the spring unit in 2020 which runs from monday august 24 - friday november 6, 2020 at the peter mccallum cancer institute in melbourne australia.

this is a full-time unit which runs for 11 weeks and takes place in melbourne australia, so obviously if you don't live there, you would need to relocate there for the duration.

during this time you will work as a spiritual carer with patients who have been diagnosed with cancer, and their families and loved ones under supervision.

if you want to get an idea of what this is like (or what it was like for me when i did the training in 2012, read or listen to my book)

there is a formal application process (closing date for applications is friday, 5 june 2020) and interview (which can be done via skype if you are not located in australia).
