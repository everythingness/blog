# the time to come

i turn on the TV and there is isabelle hupert.
many years ago i was in love with her. 

in l'avenir she teaches philosophy and the film is replete with references to philosophy and psychoanalysis. the title is a reference to derrida's idea of two distinctly different kinds of futures, the predictable planned future of appointments and schedules and the future of inexplicable and unexpected events and encounters, the time to come.

her difficult and demanding mother dies and she inherits her mother's cat, pandora. she doesn't like the cat but carries it around with her everywhere in a cane basket. pandora is big and black and heavy.

the husband leaves her for a younger woman and when he moves out he takes all the emmanuel lévinas books with her notes in them, including 'a difficult freedom'.

she buys a new copy.

the cat brings her a mouse and she makes friends with him.

i am disappointed with the film. such a great premise. what a missed opportunity : the idea of the time to come affording a difficult freedom, and claiming it.

for lévinas ethics is centred on one's responsibility to the other. he is a humanist and so the other is always a human but if we take a posthumanist framing, the face of the other — which is what for lévinas inspires the individual to care and to think beyond themselves — could be the face of a river, or a rock, or a tree, or the night sky — the face of the ten to the power of five hundred universes and the eleven dimensions. 

crucially, for lévinas, to care for the other takes place outside of an economy, there is no reward for or profit in caring for the other, either financially or in the afterlife. it is part of one's response-ability.

unfortunately in the end, it is that favourite trope of every humanist filmmaker who has run out of ideas, a baby, her first grandchild, that renews isabelle hupert's zest for life and ensures a sort of happy ending.
