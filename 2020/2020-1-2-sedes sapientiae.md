### Sedes Sapientiae

The cult of Mary is an historical religious curiosity that has become more interesting to me since I lost my aversion to religious art. If you live in Europe it's really a pity if you don't like looking at religious art ... ha ha ... particularly the early stuff. It would be like living in Australia and not being interested in Aborigi... oh wait... ðŸ˜¢ 

Not content with imagining the absolute, the infinite, the eternal as a _being_ not entirely unlike yourself, which is interested in you and what you do, id est : god, it would not be unimaginable that a religion which further imagines this usually unseen and unknowable god as taking time out from his busy schedule to walk amongst us, living with humans in the form of a more or less ordinary human, would strike a chord with those longing for a connection with the eternal. And if, in a stroke of marketing genius, you included in this narrative the impregnation (by the Holy Spirit, no less) of an ordinary woman, Mary â€” without actually doing *it* mind you, you've got a story which is going to have some serious appeal for the masses. 

And lo, if you time the birth of this god-child to coincide with the winter solstice celebrations (allowing you to also appropriate the Saturnalia festival ... let's call it ... christ-mas!! omg you are a genius...) you've got the perfect package. Well except for the addition of presents but that can come later when capitalism walks amongst us like a kind of substitute god.

In the centuries before the protestants came along and pointed out that it's somewhat ridiculous to worship an ordinary human, even if she had given birth to god almighty, which I am sure they would be the first to admit is no mean feat, artists all over Europe were working overtime to produce images of said mother and child â€” and at a time when having children still made sense, these were very popular.

Apparently one of the associated myths in the middle ages was that this god-man didn't look like an ordinary baby but was somehow born as a readymade and stern miniature man. The so-called Sedes Sapientiae (seat of wisdom) images show mother and child in a way which reflects this : full of holiness and pretty grumpy... Well so would you be if you were god and you had to learn to walk and talk and to not empty your bladder and bowel at inappropriate times and in inappropriate places.
