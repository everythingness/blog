### Another black hole

So what's [another black hole](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/04/supermassive-black-hole-discovered-near-heart-of-the-milky-way)? There are already a hundred million black holes? OK it's big - a hundred thousand times bigger than the sun, but there's a much bigger one at the centre of the galaxy, Sagittarius A*, which has the mass of 400 million suns. 

And there are bigger ones still, inside some humans. [^1]

After trapping they are drowned and marinated in armagnac. Then they are cooked and eaten by the humans whilst they hide their heads in their napkins - either to keep the aroma in or to hide their shame. But the black holes are there for all to see.  </small>
