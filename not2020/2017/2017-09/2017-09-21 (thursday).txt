I've handed in my first assignment and I am more qualified than I was 3 weeks ago but I probably should not make pronouncements about theology. OK so here I go: I was interested to discover that "someone as godless and immoral as the 45th president" can do sound theology.

If only it made an iota of difference.

Every book is a book about death, Cixous writes in 'The School of the Dead'. I think what it means is that there are really only two kinds of books: books that are about death and books that are not about death - and the ones that are not about death, in their not being about death, the absence of death in the book, means that it is a book about death.
