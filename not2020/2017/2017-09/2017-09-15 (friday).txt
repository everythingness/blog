> We have to live and suffer the defeat of truth, of our truth. We have to destroy its representation, its continuity, its memory, its trace. All subterfuges for avoiding the recognition that reality has changed, and with it truth, have to be rejected ... The very blood in our veins had been replaced.

Interestingly, this is similar to how John D.Caputo writes about religion - and how I might think, at least in my darker moments, about my disillusionment with art.
