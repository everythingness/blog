According to [this rather lovely essay in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-peculiar-poetry-of-pariss-lost-and-found) by Nadja Spiegelman, one of the items waiting to be claimed in the more than two hundred year old Bureau of Found Objects in Paris, is a red pouch containing three shards of concrete found in an abandoned suitcase shortly after 9/11 along with the bright-orange vest of an N.Y.C. transit employee.

### Week 2

in many ways this is the opposite of art school. there my cynicism was allowed full reign and its fullest possible expression encouraged. mind you, i remain *very* sceptical.

in spiritual care 1, this week i am in a different seat, at a 90 degree angle to the lecturer, where i can look out of the window and see the huge cranes busying themselves building a new building for the university, the planes coming in to land at schiphol - and the clouds.

i would pay good money for a seat like that in hermeneutics. they should put in a few couches like the ones in the library.

It's a good question.

Lying awake last night from 3am, neither trying to sleep nor trying not to sleep. Sleep doesn't come. At various points there are visions/semi-dreams. There is a cat - pixellated, black and orange, your favourite - she wants a pat and she gets one. She rolls for me. I think: this is what incessant and obsessive befriending and patting cats in the street enables: They come and visit you in visions/semi-dreams.

I am no bigger than a grain of sand - perhaps not even that big. 

How many atoms in a grain of sand?    
100 million million million.   
There is still a long way to go.
