Meanwhile, [Irving Yalom is not getting any younger](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/how-to-die/537906/) and in [la-la land](https://jobs.apple.com/us/search#&ss=health&t=0&so=&lo=0*USA&pN=0&openJobId=56398598) people who 'have something serious on their mind' are not talking to their geestelijk verzorger or their therapist but to their [boxing trainer](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/17/choosing-to-be-on-your-own) - and to...
