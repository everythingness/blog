five years ago my website consisted of this picture of me, my name and phone number and the following text:

   > how did i become what i am and why do i suffer from being what i am?   
   > â€” nietszche

that was it. 
no links. no explanations.
i'd still be happy with that but now i'd like to add :

> how did we become what we are and why do we suffer from being what we are? 

and 

> how and why do we inflict suffering on others and/or why do we allow suffering to continue to be inflicted on others? 

and 

> do i need to continue to suffer - and to make others suffer?

it might have taken five years but this is significant progress, no?

merry xmas. enjoy your turkeys.
