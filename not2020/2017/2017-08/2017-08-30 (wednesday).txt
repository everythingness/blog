## Wednesday, August 30, 2017Today I speak in Berlin. If you are there, [come](http://spektrumberlin.de/events/detail/xen-presents-how-could-a-posthumanist-be.html)!

I might say this : 

> The problem for each of us, if 'we' = 'humanoids', is that we are, and are about not to be. 'We' live in this shadow and we don't acknowledge this shadow.

> That is an individual problem. It is a (not insignificant) problem for the individual and perhaps for some of those who know and care about that individual - if indeed anyone does - but it is not at all a problem for the world or the universe or the ten to the power of five hundred universes and the eleven dimensions or for any of the trillions of neutrinos and photons that pass through an individual's body every second of every day. 

> It is in the very nature of this problem that I find a major clue to begin to come to something resembling an understanding of what I am, what it means to say that I am, and what it is to be and not to be.

> That is one side of the coin, if I may use such an unfortunate phrase. The other side of it is a collective problem. The problem of the world, the problem of our relationship, as humans, to matter, to things, to non-human beings and to each Other. 

> The idea, and I am by no means alone in this, is that we construct a *post* &nbsp;human(ist) approach to these problems.

> How do we begin? I say, let's not begin by reading Deleuze. Or Nietzsche. Or Heidegger. Or Braidotti. Let's begin by having a conversation. And let's not begin the conversation by talking about whatever Deleuze (or whoever) said... :) Let's work it out for ourselves, right here and now.

On the other hand, I might say something else.
