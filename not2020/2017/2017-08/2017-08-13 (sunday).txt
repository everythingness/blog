I am reminded of the On Kawara date paintings. Why he didn't paint the names of the weekdays as well I shall never fathom, but nevertheless... 

> When asked for his biography for an exhibition catalogue he would respond simply with the number of days elapsed between his date of birth and the date of the exhibition opening. When he died aged 81, he would not have wanted an obituary. He would have preferred the page to be left blank except for his name and the number of days he had been alive: On Kawara, artist, 29,771 days between late December 1932 and late June 2014.
