[Richmond fan](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-25/richmond-in-the-blood-tigers-more-than-just-a-footy-team/8835606) Joan Chapple, 90, has been a member for 73 years, and has seen it all. 

>"We feel like angels trapped inside the bodies of beasts, craving transcendence and all the time trying to spread our wings and fly off, and it's really a very odd predicament to be in, if you think about it."

Joan did not say that. It was Vilayanur S. Ramachandran in the *The Emerging Mind*, but it is how a lot of people who go for the Tigers feel. And also people who don't go for them. And even people who don't care for Australian Football.

Georgina Tsang is an artist I did a session with in Liverpool earlier this year.

She writes :
> My partner and I did a joint therapy session with Johannes which simply began with the question, "what is this?" (usually "what are you?" for individual sessions). It floored me and the conversation and silence that ensued really changed my perspective irrevocably. My answer was 'a collaboration'. We talked about quantum physics, veganism, the role of the sublime and beauty, the breakdown of binaryism, Descartes and Kant, the importance of optimism and sadness. We both left changed.

> The liberating idea that there is nothing special about the human or indeed my perspective really threw me. I walked down the street aware that I was no more valued than the lampost to the passer-bys. I felt a real freedom.

### THINGS EXIST WITHIN ME

(As seen today on the T-shirt of a person cycling past.)  
I'll just leave that hanging there.
