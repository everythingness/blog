For nearly forty years Australia afforded me distance, distance from everything that pained me and that was difficult for me. And then I didn't need it anymore - or rather, the opportunity presented itself to find out whether or not I still needed the distance. 

And now perhaps it’s becoming apparent that I don’t.
