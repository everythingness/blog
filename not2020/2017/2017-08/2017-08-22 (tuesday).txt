This is really something : [The therapist who saved my life - On the possibility of not killing oneself](http://lithub.com/the-therapist-who-saved-my-life/) by Ella Wilson.

> Over the years I have tried more ways to escape this misery than one hopes for in a lifetime from Western remedies to Eastern medicine to ideas that neither hemisphere is willing to claim. But nothing has ever shifted the sense I have that I am not supposed to be alive. And when existing feels this foreign and hopeless, like getting off a plane in Nairobi to realize you have forgotten to pack your legsâ€š dying does not seem like the bad idea that most people think it is.

The Volkskrant reports that [the government routinely obtains the travel records of students](https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/fraudejagers-ministerie-neuzen-in-ov-chipkaarten-studenten~a4512350/) who receive financial assistance from the company that produces the microchipped travel cards, to check if they are fraudulently claiming to be living independently. Meanwhile [health insurance companies want to give their clients a free Apple Watch](https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/hoe-zorgverzekeraars-gezonde-mensen-willen-belonen-geef-ze-een-smartwatch~a4512293/) but only if the client is prepared to allow the insurance company to access the details produced by the watch about their daily activities, heart rate, blood pressure etc - and, one assumes, adjust your premium accordingly.
