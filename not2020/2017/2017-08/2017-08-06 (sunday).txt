# Tuscany (Sunday, 6 August, 2017)

I am Auguste Piccard who wanted to see the   
sea from below and the sky from above. When    
his cabin sprung a leak at nine kilometres,  
he repaired it with cotton and wax and at  
fifteen point eight seven one kilometres  
he measured the cosmic rays.

"Ah humans, she said, they are awesome."  
And she is right of course — I am  
full of awe for them and yes but no —   
they are also at the same time so   
very awful. Oh dear sweet lord that   
I don’t believe in, what monsters   
you created, what slaves and masters,   
what victims, what torturers...
