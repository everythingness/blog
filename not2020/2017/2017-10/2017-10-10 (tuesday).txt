## Tuesday, October 10, 2017![](http://posthumanist.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IMG_1423.JPG)i am the red and orange hips   
of dog rose bushes being   
swallowed whole by blackbirds

i am the rotting leaves   
of horse chestnut trees   
pungent underneath conkers

i am the dusty blue   
bloom of ripe sloes   
on a blackthorn hedge

i am the seeds hidden   
in the wings of propellers   
spinning down from sycamore trees

(apologies to derwent may)
