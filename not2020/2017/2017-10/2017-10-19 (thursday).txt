## Thursday, October 19, 2017we are devil coach horses   
hiding   
among fallen leaves and   
laying our eggs there.

we are devil coach horses    
we will open our jaws and   
and lift our rear parts   
(like scorpions)  
and release a foul smell  
(if you disturb us).

we are the corpses  
of devil coach horses  
in the handles of  
haymakers' sickles.
