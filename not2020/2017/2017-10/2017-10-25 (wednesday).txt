i am more than a little excited to be doing a gig in what is now, again and for the next year or two at least, my hometown : utrecht. this is where i was born and raised (until the age of 14) and here i am, 45 years later, hosting  

p o s t h u m a n i s t  &nbsp; c o n v e r s a t i o n s

at [casco](http://casco.art) lange nieuwstraat 7, just a couple of blocks from the dom.
the number 2 bus will take you there from utrecht centraal station.

there will be ten meetings on the last sunday of each month - except in december and august, starting this sunday 29th october at 3pm (the meeting in september 2018 will decide whether to continue in 2018/19).
