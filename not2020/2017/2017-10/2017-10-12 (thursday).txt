 "...paradise has a price and i hope this will be the price for paradise..."
 
 hell hath no fury like that reserved by the media (and twitterers and commenters on online stories) for a woman (a mother! an ex-punk rocker!) who turns her back on her country and marries a man half her age and urges people to do radical things for political reasons. 

well RIP sally jones, if you are in fact dead. i hope your dog and your child are ok.
