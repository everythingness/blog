I am not sure how interesting [the exhibition Dali/Duchamp at the Royal Academy in London](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/magazine/culture/dali-duchamp-surreal-art-royal-academy-london-7r7qz0bls) could possibly be (putting well known art works next to each other in the same room and showing a few old films on a loop together with some letters and postcards in a display case rarely is) but the fact that Dali and Duchamp were firm friends, which is new to me, is.

Here they are together in August 1958 in Cadaques. Duchamp is 71 and Dali 54. Are they holding hands? Is Duchamp trying to give something to Dali? Gala (Elena Ivanovna Diakonova), muse, long-time companion (and married) to Dali, looks on. I find myself wishing there was another photograph - of Gala, taken at the same time from behind Dali and Duchamp, so we could see the expression on her face.
