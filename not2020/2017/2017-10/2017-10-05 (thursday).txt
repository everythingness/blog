#### a message from the other side

for an exercise in class yesterday we were asked to do some mirror writing. i immediately thought about the flip side, the dark side of spiritual care. is it possible or indeed necessary to ask people why they want to be a spiritual carer? misschien is er een leegte in hen? or maybe they enjoy the power it gives them? and i wrote this:

it is quite uncanny reading it back : it's as if someone else wrote it - but i **know** i did write it. it reminds me of when you write something in the middle of the night, when there is a dream you wanted to remember, and then you find it next to the bed in the morning and you don't remember writing it. it's like a message from the unconscious - from the other side.
