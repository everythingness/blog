### The event (Badiou)

> An event is an unpredictable break in our everyday worlds that opens new possibilities. The three conditions for an event are: that something happens to us (by pure accident, no destiny, no determinism), that we name what happens, and that we remain faithful to it. In Badiou’s philosophy, we become subjects through the event. By naming it and maintaining fidelity to the event, the subject emerges as a subject to its truth. ‘Being there,’ as traditional phenomenology would have it, is not enough. 

I found this in an article by Vincenzo Di Nicola 1 [here](https://aeon.co/essays/take-your-time-the-seven-pillars-of-a-slow-thought-manifesto).

One of the things I like about Badiou's notion of 'the event' is the three conditions: 

1. the event must *befall* you — it 'happens', you have no control over it.
2. you *name the event* (and/or tell the story of it?)
3. you *remain faithful* to the event (could this be useful for thinking about the faith of the faithless...?)

[1]     Di Nicola is a [scary looking](https://blog.apaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Di-Nicola.jpg) philosopher/psychiatrist who is proposing an ‘evental psychiatry’ which "will describe both how we get stuck in our everyday worlds, and what makes change and new things possible for us." see [here](https://blog.apaonline.org/2017/11/23/badiou-the-event-and-psychiatry-part-1-trauma-and-event/) and [here](https://blog.apaonline.org/2017/11/30/badiou-the-event-and-psychiatry-part-2-psychiatry-of-the-event/).

Nathan Aandagt's shop Hoogstraat 115 Rotterdam was destroyed on 14 May 1940 by the Nazi bombardments. Two and a half years later, on the 15th of October 1942, the Red Cross recorded his arrival in Westerbork. 

I imagine Nathan standing there as his details are being written on this pink index card. Perhaps he would have had to spell his name. The word 'aandacht' (= attention) is normally written with 'ch' not 'g'.

Either on or soon after the 23rd of October 1942, someone wrote in red pencil diagonally across the card that Nathan had been put on a 'Trspt'. 

A different hand has written the fact that he was 'no longer i Wbk'. It was a time of abbreviations. There was no time to record that every Saturday Nathan had sent his assistant to Brummelkamp at 194 Hoogstraat to buy cake. 

He died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz three days later.

> If we affirm one single moment, we thus affirm not only ourselves but all existence. For nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us ourselves nor in things; and if our soul has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event—and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.
