### Autumn

In the northern hemisphere, it's the first day of spring.

Walking in the Garden here in the southern hemisphere this morning, a tourist asks me: 'What is it like here in autumn?'  
It’s a clear, bright day. There is not a breath of wind and not a hint of a cloud in the sky.  
'It *is* autumn!' I say, 'it's like this.'

But of course it's more complicated than that. It's like this and not like this - and everything in between. To know what it's like, you have to be here for the whole of autumn, and for many other autumns. I'd say thirty six would do it. And then you know what autumn is like here.

And maybe then it’s time to head north again.
