title: mijn naam is haas ... ha ah ah es ... HAAS

*hallo mijn naam is haas*  
i am a meta-monk   
my cloister is   
the human condition  
and this is the garden.

i am a postmodern post-atheist   
hermit without a habit   
who lives in a cell   
with a skylight and a   
108cm screen and six eleven inch   
macbooks air with eight gigabytes    
of ram (one of which i gave away the other day)

i have seen into   
the very core   
of being itself.

and what is there?   
you will ask.

and i will say [nothing](beckett-nothing).*
