So what is next? How to begin? 

We might begin by reconsidering (examining, investigating) our relation to our so-called selves, or to other humans, or to each other (animal, tree, rock, river) to the world, or to the universe, or indeed to the ten to the power of five hundred universes and the eleven dimensions â€” or even all of the above, since they are entangled, simultaneously.

We might begin with a conversation about these things and no-things.
