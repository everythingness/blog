a certain look is required when reading a forbidden book and this bloke had it down to a T.

### tuesday 11

we are the blackcaps  
about amongst the leaves  
in woods and lanes

we are the whitethroats  
skulking in the twigs  
of hawthorn hedges 

we are the treecreepers  
creeping up tree trunks 

we are the nuthatches  
leaping about in  
the tops of trees.

Mischa de Vreede : 

> Dat is wel het vervelendste van het doodgaan van mensen: dat jij met hen ook alles wat je voor hen betekende verliest. Wat de overledene in je zag, dat ben je niet meer. Wat je voor hem of haar betekende, beteken je niet meer. Zoals je met hem of haar praatte, die speciale taal is mee gestorven en je verhalen moet je in andere woorden zien kwijt te raken. Niet alleen ben je de ander kwijt, je gaat zelf ook een beetje verloren.

> Every era has to reinvent the project of "spirituality" for itself. (Spirituality = plans, terminologies, ideas of deportment aimed at the resolution of painful structural contradictions inherent in the human situation, at the completion of human consciousness, at transcendence.)

### the names of things

proust said (or wrote) that *you can say anything as long as you don't say 'I'* or so i'm told — or read somewhere, but not in the original. so many things are said to have been said by proust, or camus, or for that matter, schopenhauer. still, it doesn't matter if it was proust or not. the point is something about a tekst is different if it doesn't contain the word 'I'. in english you have the option of writing 'i' instead of 'I' and because of the contrast with how an english reader usually sees the first personal pronoun written it can have an effect.

in german it is the names of things that are written with a capital (as well as the polite form of you : Sie) and the first personal pronoun is in lower case but in the english language, the only word that gets a capital in the middle of a sentence which is not a proper name is the first personal pronoun — and maybe 'thou' was? how odd that is. does it reveal an essential difference in the way the germans and the english regard the world?

i propose another variation which is to not only use lower case but to enclose the first personal pronoun in brackets. what would be better (i) or [i]?
