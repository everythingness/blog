## an aside

I was reading the [obituaries of Murray Gell-Mann](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/opinion/gell-mann-physics.html), the physicist who 'invented' quarks and a couple of things struck me. 

He proposed a physical quantity — “strangeness” — that would explain why some particles last longer than others. I couldn't help but smile at this. Could it be your strangeness that determines how long you last? 

That would mean there is hope for us nerds and queer folk!

But what is real "strangeness" is that he became interested in complexity and complexity research which studies "the emergence of new kinds of order that are only manifest when systems are large and messy."

An remarkable move for someone who became famous for their work with the most fundamental building blocks of nature, seemingly simplification in its purest form.
