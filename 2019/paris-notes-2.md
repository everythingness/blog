so this sad story begins in a room in a hotel on the rue de dunquerke directly opposite the entrance of one of paris's main railway stations. the photos app on my phone seems to think it's a hospital. which would be appropriate in my case.

the room is small and blue and orange and the bathroom is twice as big as the bedroom but i was grateful for it yesterday when i needed to rest my back and my hip and everything else was aching. i also needed to NOT feel like i was trying to get somewhere in time to make a connection to somewhere else and not being able to make it. 

> everyone that comes, or goes, slams their door HARD and oftenasnot does some random yelling, usually in an incomprehensible language — or no language. it is the same with life and the world which let's face it, when it all comes down to it, is a disappointment. 

in australia, in wagga wagga, i felt like i lived in a place where civilisation had only partly arrived and probably never would. it got stuck somewhere in sydney or in melbourne and it ran out of credit or frequent flyer points or the company that had them went bust. there were a lot of sheep and for a few years i lived even further from civilisation some fifty miles out of town in a dilapidated farmhouse where even the TV signal didn't reach. the mangy sheep in the dusty paddocks were on the whole unhappy and complained a lot. you promised us grass, they said. hang on, that wasn't me! maybe the farmer did so complain to him. 

> but what's the use complaining? i gave up complaining a long time ago. and i stopped being angry. it is not that i had to make an effort to not be angry, the anger just left me and all i could feel was sadness. and then i wasn't sad anymore, or rarely, when i was being loved by someone who was smart and beautiful and good and then they stopped loving me and what do you do then?

maudlin is a better word than sad because it has its roots in the weeping mary magdalene beloved of the anonymous religious painters of the middle ages. she weeps, as i do, not for herself but for the world, its cruelty and its stupidity although to be fair when it comes down to it when all is said and done, and even before it is, it is not the world that's cruel and stupid but the humans that live in it and that have lived in it. they are the ones who have made it what it is more or less and even if quite a few of them did and are doing their best, they are far outnumbered by the ones who dontgiveashit and the ones who only give a shit about themselves and maybe a few people that they are related to or are fucking.

here in paris civilisation, such as it is, did arrive and it was wonderful. it filled the people with hope for the future, even the ones that couldn't afford champagne and pretty dresses with shocking pink details or simple but stylish ones with stripes. everything is possible, they thought. they did more than think, they KNEW or at least believed, that better things would come and more of them, enough for everybody! and at a reasonable price. we are rational people now they said, most of them had gotten rid of their gods, if not their idols.

and then there was a big recession and things got tough for a while and then the nazis came and put a big dampener on things. when you see pictures of de beauvoir or camus taken in 1945 they don't look happy even though the nazis were gone.

the ones who were born after the war came of age in the so called sixties and they were briefly optimistic and/or outraged and radical in thought and/or action but then everything tightened up and everyone ran for cover and had kids and they needed looking after and they were big on expensive branded clothing and other overpriced consumer products and before you could say late capitalism or liberal individualism their kids were running the show — and they hate people over forty just as we did before we turned forty ourselves.

> i am an inbetweener, born in the years between generation x and the baby boomers and my loyalties were chiefly divided amongst punks and the hippies. i wanted love and peace but i also hated everything and thought the world was a sham. so what do you do? well you drink a lot of beer and wine and liquor and you take all the drugs you can lay your hands on. i don't regret a single minute of that life but now i sometimes think i may have used up reserves that would have been useful to me now...

the internet went out last night and didn't come back. maybe it was hanging around on a street corner somewhere at the back of the gare du nord freebasing meth or whatever it is those exotic looking and excited young people are freebasing these days. 

> ah to have a surplus of energy — or even some in reserve! yes i am sorry to say this is going to be a sad story, one where i end up going back to where i came from instead of to the south of france. it is too far. the trains are full and i am tired oh lord.
