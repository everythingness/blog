## wednesday may 22, 2019 : ravens

In Japanese mythology, ravens are disruptive creatures, omens of turbulent times. In the photographs of photographer [Masahisa Fukase](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/13/masahisa-fukase-photographed-nothing-but-his-wif) they are symbols of lost love and almost unendurable heartbreak. For 13 years his only photographs were of his wife, Yoko. In the ten years following the end of the relationship he photographed only ravens.

He had a near fatal fall and for the last 20 years of his life he was in a coma.

#### revelation

From an extraordinary essay by Jia Tolentino, [_Losing Religion and Finding Ecstasy in Houston_ in The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/27/losing-religion-and-finding-ecstasy-in-houston) :

> The nature of a revelation is that you don’t have to reëxperience it. In the seventies, researchers believed that MDMA treatment could be discrete and limited—that once you got the message, as they put it, you could hang up the phone. You would be better for having listened. You would be changed. They don’t say this about religion, but they should.

Quite.
