what's wrong with humans? why do they have to name everything? is 'stargazers' the right term for people who look at the night sky whilst holding up a chart like this? 

i like this one better, for two reasons :

one reason : it's not trying to be a map â€” a map is useful when you are going somewhere. this is just a mass of dots, some are planets and some are stars. the other reason is : it is the inverse of the point of view  of a human standing on the earth looking up at a particular point in time and in a particular place. it's an image from some rocket thing with a camera in it looking back in the general direction of the milky way. oh wait maybe it's not. ah well what's the difference?
