title: hello

hello. thanks for looking me up. 

if you want to know about the work i do with people, the best way is to meet up for a drink, and/or a talk, if necessary due the tyranny of distance, on the internet. 

and/or you can have a look at the [work page](work) but i am never fully satisfied with what i write about the work. and i don't have an elevator pitch.

if you are interested in my [writing](writing), my book is called [i am here](http://www.johannesk.com/writing/i-am-here) and [this is a four part series, *moederland*, commissioned by the now sadly defunct magazine tincture](moederland) in 2017 en [hier is een stuk van/over/door mij in het nederlands uit trouw van 2019](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2jy97tofaac9b9/TROUW%20scan%2020190301-134339.pdf?dl=0).

or, if you're short of time, here is [my piece in the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/29/how-to-die-well) on dying.

and now here you are.  
or so it would appear.   
this is my so-called [blog](http://johannesk.blot.im).

there might be some [news](news), unlikely though.

don't hesitate to [get in touch](contact).  
i'll always make time.
