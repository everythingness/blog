i am going to write a book without a title or author.  
on the cover there will be three stars arranged in a pyramid shape.  
and that is all...

<small>in typography an asterism denotes  a break in passages or the absence of something. it is used to indicate minor breaks in text, to call attention to a passage, or to separate sub-chapters in a book. </small>
