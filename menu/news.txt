The Dutch daily newspaper [Trouw](https://www.trouw.nl) published an interview/article about me in their series on making meaning (zingeving) accompanied by this awesome photograph by [Lars van den Brink](https://www.larsvandenbrink.nl/about/) featuring the brutalist architecture of the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam and me looking grumpy because it was bitterly cold and raining and Lars kept saying, let's try it here and and then let's try it there.

The London Times has [a regular feature](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/luxx/the-humanity-test-natalie-massenet-founder-of-net-a-porter-0ltvhf20k), the Humanity Test, a version of the Proust questions, where they ask allegedly interesting people a series of standard questions to which they respond wittily, intelligently and in an interesting way — or not, as the case might be. [These would be my answers.](/humanity_test)
