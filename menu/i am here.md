you can buy it in any bookshop. ask them to order it for you.  
support your local bookshop!   

<small>or you can buy it online [direct from the publisher](https://scribepublications.co.uk/books-authors/books/i-am-here) or from the usual outlets. in the netherlands why not order it from athenaeum in amsterdam? or bijleveld in utrecht? </small>

<small>it is also available for kindle and as an ibook. you can borrow the book from you library. it will soon be available in an audio version — and you can read parts of it on google books.</small>

*i am here* is about my experience of training and working as an atheist pastoral carer in a major cancer hospital in australia and my encounters with some of the people in the hospital — and the meaning of life. inevitably the ten to the power of five hundred universes and the eleven dimensions also make an appearance.[^1]

here is [the review from the weekend australian](https://app.box.com/s/k392v36x0fgqo2milcksh9vjescyl3ns) and here are some [reviews of the book written by people affected by cancer](https://app.box.com/s/adc1vt2hnfojfn0vtxnvqg23pkyg9q4q) (from macmillan uk). 

you can listen to me talking about the book [with jo good on bbc london](https://app.box.com/s/1yvyv635l8wjwuitbr8f0e3r9i79o8af) and/or [with tony delroy on the abc in australia](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dexy0w6iqf86a97/nightlife-abc.mp3?dl=0).

[^1]: ... several appearances in fact, to the point that it made [the sole US reviewer on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Here-stories-cancer-ward-ebook/product-reviews/B01FG7DKP8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews) want to scream :) fortunately there were plenty of [amazon reviewers in other parts of the world](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Here-stories-cancer-ward-ebook/dp/B01FG7DKP8/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=klabbers+i+am+here&qid=1583056622&sr=8-1#customerReviews) who liked it.
